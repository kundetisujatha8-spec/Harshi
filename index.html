        <p>Seven years of friendship is not a small thing.
We may not call or text every single day, but our bond has never changed.
Time only made our friendship stronger and more meaningful.
I’m so grateful for these beautiful years with you🌸</p>

        <p>Even if we don’t talk daily, we understand each other without explanations.
That comfort, that peace, that silent support — it’s rare and special.
With you, I never have to pretend.
Thank you for being my safe place❄️</p>

        <p>Happy or sad, good or bad — we always share everything.
You are the first person I think of when something happens in my life.
Thank you for listening supporting and without judging without conditions.
That means more than you know💫 </p>

        <p>I still believe in true friendship because of you.
My trust in friendship exists because you stayed.
We supported each other in every phase, lifted each other when things were hard,
and cared in ways words can’t fully explain✨</p>
